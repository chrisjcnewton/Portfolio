				<div class='projectTitle'>Little Big Planet Web Widget</div>
				<div class='text'>We were asked to help DRUM build a Little Big Planet 'web widget' for Sony. The widget was a 'bookmarklet' that the user could drag from an HTML Banner ad into their bookmarks bar. They could then lauch it on any website and drag stickers to decorate the site. A screenshot of their creation could then be entered into a competition to win a prize and shared on Facebook and Twitter.
					<br/><br/>My role was to build the main bookmarklet which involved heavy use of the canvas HTML 5 element and solving various cross domain image issues.

				<div class='projectTitle'>IKEA Kitchens Quality Tester</div>
				<div class='text'>We were asked to help Mother London redesign and develop the kitchens section of the IKEA website. Part of the redeign involved the building of an asset to demonstrate the amount of testing that IKEA kitchens go through. The idea invovled 'dragging' an IKEA employee through a test kitchen and revealing information about the various tests that the kitchens undergo. 
					<br/><br/>My role was to build the initial prototype and help shape the interaction, assist on the shoot with technical direction and build the final asset.

				<div class='projectTitle'>Cracker Pull Facebook App</div>
				<div class='text'>We worked with Adam and Eve to deliver a social media campaign for Phones 4 U, based around the idea of sharing crackers with friends on Facebook. Users were given a virtual box of crackers to pull with their friends, which resulted in a movie sequence of a Christmas lunch using Facebook profile pictures that revealed if you had won a prize.
					<br/><br/>My role was to build the video asset which incorporated the users Facebook profile pictures tracked into the live action video. Tasks included building the initial prototype, assisting on the shoot with technical direction, tracking the photo frames in the video and exporting the data and building the final asset.
