						<div class='text'>We were asked to help DRUM build a Little Big Planet 'web widget' for Sony. The widget was a 'bookmarklet' that the user could drag from an HTML Banner ad into their bookmarks bar. They could then launch it on any website and drag stickers to decorate the site. A screenshot of their creation could then be entered into a competition to win a prize and shared on Facebook and Twitter.
							<br/><br/>My role was to build the main bookmarklet which involved heavy use of the canvas HTML 5 element, DOM manipilation and solving various cross domain image issues for the client side screenshot feature.

						<div class='text'>We were asked to help Livemusic.fm create a real-time instagram crowd stream for an upcoming Miles Kane gig. The audience members could take a picture, post it to instagram using the hashtag #livemusicmk and instantly see the picture appear on a screen projected at the venue. The live app could be accessed via a phone webapp to moderate and block some users if required.
							<br/><br/>My role was to build the socket server to interact with the Real-time instagram api using Node.js and the client-side scrolling images app which was projected at the venue.

						<div class='text'>A colleague and I wanted to showcase what was possible using the twitter api in an interesting and engaging way. 
							<br/><br/>My role was to build the site using server side code to interact with the twitter api and creating the client side app to show those tweets using three.js and CSS 3D transforms. The app allows the user to interact with the app without signing in until the number of requests exceeds twitters limit. The user can then choose to login to gain many more requests.

						<div class='text'>HSBC required a digital magazine filled with exlusive content for its high-end investors. The magazine needed to updated by the client via a CMS andthen published out to Native iOS and Android applications. 
							<br/><br/>My role was to build the Android client app. It was a mix of native development in Java and bridging the HTML magazine content downloaded by the app from the CMS. Each issue could be donloaded and stored for offline use. The client was able to publish new issues via the CMS which the app would automatically detect and download if the user required it.

						<div class='text'>AA planned to discontinue their highly successful printed members magazine, in favour of a more modern digital equivalent. We were asked to provide a next generation digital magazine to replace it that could be viewed online and on tablet PCs. The magazine is driven by a CMS that creates HTML magazine content and publishes it out to the web and in a downloadable form for the iOS and Android apps 
							<br/><br/>My role was to build the Android client app. It was a mix of native development in Java and bridging the HTML magazine content downloaded by the app from the CMS. The native part of the application allowed the user to choose a magazine issue that they wanted to view. The app would then download and store the HTML content localy, so that it could be viewed offline. The app then allowed users to swipe between each page of the magazine and navigate it with a menu.

						<div class='text'>We were asked to help Mother London redesign and develop the kitchens section of the IKEA website. Part of the redeign involved the building of an asset to demonstrate the amount of testing that IKEA kitchens go through. The idea invovled 'dragging' an IKEA employee through a test kitchen and revealing information about the various tests that the kitchens undergo. 
							<br/><br/>My role was to build the initial prototype and help shape the interaction, assist on the shoot with technical direction and build the final asset.

						<div class='text'>We worked with Adam and Eve to deliver a social media campaign for Phones 4 U, based around the idea of sharing crackers with friends on Facebook. Users were given a virtual box of crackers to pull with their friends, which resulted in a movie sequence of a Christmas lunch using Facebook profile pictures that revealed if you had won a prize.
							<br/><br/>My role was to build the flash video asset which dynamically loaded the users Facebook profile pictures and tracked them into the live action video. Tasks included building the initial prototype, assisting on the shoot with technical direction, tracking the photo frames in the video and exporting the data to flash, then building the final asset to be integrated onto the facebook page.
