					<div class='text'>We were asked to help DRUM build a Little Big Planet 'web widget' for Sony. The widget was a 'bookmarklet' that the user could drag from an HTML Banner ad into their bookmarks bar. They could then launch it on any website and drag stickers to decorate the site. A screenshot of their creation could then be entered into a competition to win a prize and shared on Facebook and Twitter.
						<br/><br/>My role was to build the main bookmarklet which involved heavy use of the canvas HTML 5 element and solving various cross domain image issues.

					<div class='text'>We were asked to help Livemusic.fm create a real-time instagram crowd stream for an upcoming Miles Kane gig. The audience members could take a picture, post it to instagram using the hashtag #livemusicmk and instantly see the picture appear on a screen projected at the venue. 
						<br/><br/>My role was to build the socket server to interact with the Real-time instagram api using Node.js and the client-side scrolling images app which was projected at the venue.

					<div class='text'>A colleague and I wanted to showcase what was possible using the twitter api in an interesting and engaging way. 
						<br/><br/>My role was to build the site using server side code to interact with the twitter api and creating the client side app to show those tweets using three.js and CSS 3D transforms. The app allows the user to interact with the app without signing in until the number of requests exceeds twitters limit. The user can then choose to login to gain many more requests.

						<br/><br/>My role was to build the Android client app. It was a mix of native development in Java and bridging the HTML magazine content downloaded by the app from the CMS.

					<div class='text'>We were asked to help Mother London redesign and develop the kitchens section of the IKEA website. Part of the redeign involved the building of an asset to demonstrate the amount of testing that IKEA kitchens go through. The idea invovled 'dragging' an IKEA employee through a test kitchen and revealing information about the various tests that the kitchens undergo. 
						<br/><br/>My role was to build the initial prototype and help shape the interaction, assist on the shoot with technical direction and build the final asset.

					<div class='text'>We worked with Adam and Eve to deliver a social media campaign for Phones 4 U, based around the idea of sharing crackers with friends on Facebook. Users were given a virtual box of crackers to pull with their friends, which resulted in a movie sequence of a Christmas lunch using Facebook profile pictures that revealed if you had won a prize.
						<br/><br/>My role was to build the video asset which incorporated the users Facebook profile pictures tracked into the live action video. Tasks included building the initial prototype, assisting on the shoot with technical direction, tracking the photo frames in the video and exporting the data and building the final asset.
